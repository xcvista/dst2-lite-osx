DST2
====

DST2 is the new Distributed Subtitle Team Workshop (a.k.a Deefun Suntitle Tools). This new tool is designed to workwith groups, and provide easier and more powerful subtitle styling options.

DST2 will, instead of being open-sourced, a close-sourced commericial product. It will be free to personal and non-commericial teams, but commericial use will cost a fee. A functional-reduced DST2-lite will be released as open-source, though.

The new software will be cross-platform. This repo contains the OS X version of the DST2, which have its own base implementation and rendering engine. There will be Linux and Windows versions as well, using Windows version as the base implementation.

The video rendering feature of DST2 will be very powerful in the OS X version, employing Apple's Core Image, Core Graphics, Core Text, Core Animation and AVFoundation features.

New subtitle formats will be introduced as well, called SubJSON. SubJSON is a less human readable format, but is strongly customizable using CSS that is both directly editable and visually manupilatable.

Compliance of Deefun Subtitle Tools
===================================

All existing features in legacy Deefun Subtitle Tools will be included as part of open-sourced DST2-lite.
